## Initial announcements, logistics, resources


Hi everyone, Welcome to Algorithms!

We'll use the following resources: 


* __Github:__ This Github site hosts all _public_ resources for this class, such as syllabus, lecture notes, policies, etc. 

* __Canvas__: The class also has  a _Canvas_ site, accessible through your Bowdoin portal, that hosts the online quizzes and also video recordings, solutions, and other private resources we'll use throughout the semester.  The scores for all your work in the class will be kept in Canvas. 


* __Gradescope__: We'll use Gradescope for the assignments (and possibly also for the exams). You'll use Gradescope to submit the assignments and to check the feedback you receive. The assignments on Gradescope are linked with the Canvas,  so your Gradescope scores will automatically pop up in Canvas.  Gradescope helps streamline the process of submission, grading and returning feedback, and it is also useful for implementing practices like anonymous grading.

* __Slack__: Class communication will be entirely on Slack. You will need to monitor Slack for class updates, including possible cancellations and location changes (in case there are any). You can contact me and any of the LAs by private messaging on Slack. 

* __Zoom link__: All classes will be in person. If at any point we'll need to meet on Zoom, I'll send a zoom link on Slack. 

If you are registered for the class, you will be added to the Gradescope site for the class (you'll receive an invitation to join).
