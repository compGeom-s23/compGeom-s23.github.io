### Project Partner Policy

All projects are partner-optional.  You and your partner(s) will work together on the assignment throughout the whole process, you will write it and review it together, and will submit one assignment. The assignment must be a true joint effort, equally owned, created and understood by both partners. Specifically splitting the assignment and working on the problems separately is not allowed and violates the honor code for the class.

### Project Collaboration policy 

Unless otherwise specified, projects are at __collaboration-level 1__; that is, verbal collaboration without solution sharing. You are allowed and encouraged to discuss ideas with other class members, but the communication should be verbal. No one is allowed to take notes during the discussion (being able to recreate the solution later from memory is proof that you actually understood it). Communication needs to stay at a high level and cannot include sharing pseudo-code for the problem.

There are lots of resources online, such as papers, animations, visualizations, video recordings, which you are encouraged to explore to help you understand the material.

### Emergencies and personal circumstances

If you have any significant circumstances that  will impact your ability to meet a deadline, please let me know as soon as possible so that we can make a plan. Note that the circumstances have to be _significant_ (for e.g. taking two classes with homework deadlines teh same day does not count as an unusual circumstance). 


### Honor Code 

All students are expected to be familiar with and to comply with the department's [collaboration policy](https://turing.bowdoin.edu/dept/collab.php)  and the four levels of collaboration it outlines.
